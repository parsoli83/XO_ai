# XO_ai
a tic tac toe playing ai using minimax algorithm

## Usage:

to get the code run the following command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parsoli83/XO_ai.git
```

use python3 to run the code

```bash
python3 xo.py
```

## about the algorithm

this AI uses minimax algorithm to evaluate the best move in each term. minimax is an algorithm based on maximizing the chance of our win and minimization of the chance of loss. This is achieved with computing the score of each possible move and comparing them is a recursive way.
